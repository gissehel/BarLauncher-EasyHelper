# BarLauncher-EasyHelper

A bar launcher helper to create plugins for applications like Wox or Flow Launcher.

**BarLauncher-EasyHelper** define a bar launcher plugin API different from the Wox original one or the Flow Launcher original one that if you follow it, your code will only depend on interfaces for the main code, thus will be testable without needing the Wox code or Flow Launcher code for tests.
